# tasty-recommend


Concept: A recipe recommendation website that uses AI to personalize recipe suggestions based on a user's dietary restrictions, preferences, and available ingredients.
Description: This website would allow users to input their dietary needs (vegan, gluten-free, etc.), flavor preferences (spicy, sweet, etc.), and any ingredients they already have on hand. The AI would then generate recipe recommendations that fit the user's criteria. This would save users time and frustration from browsing through countless recipes that don't meet their needs.
